                Channel The Shining at The Stanley Hotel, Estes Park
            </h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/Stanley-Hotel-Haunted-Colorado.jpg"
                    alt="Stephen King's The Shining">
                <figcaption>
                    Named one of the world’s best horror tales of all time, Stephen King’s ‘The Shining’ stemmed from a
                    stay at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Upon checking in on a dark evening in 1974, King and his wife found themselves to be the only guests
                staying that night. The isolated hotel’s grand yet eerie presence inspired the book’s Overlook Hotel,
                while the author experienced unsettling sightings and vivid nightmares, adding fuel to the story’s
                supernatural themes. Nestled in the Rocky Mountains, The Stanley Hotel was built in 1909 and still
                retains its history, attracting a large number of The Shining fans each year. The interior has been
                renovated over time but still has a turn-of-the-century feel and is said to have ‘high spirited
                activity.’ </p>
            <h3>Become Buffalo Bill at Linger Eatery, Denver</h3>
            <p>
                Once a mortuary that held the remains of Buffalo Bill, this hotspot is now one of the coolest eateries
                in Denver. The site is the former base of the Olinger family’s funeral business and famed mortuary,
                which was once responsible for organising half of the city’s funerals. This included the retention of
                Buffalo Bill Cody’s body in 1917, while Wyoming and Colorado argued over who would provide his final
                resting place (Colorado won). When the space was purchased by its new owners, they immediately embraced
                the spot’s morbid history and the dark interior. </p>
            <h3>Visit the Mystery Mansion, Boulder</h3>
            <p>
                Due to its past history as a cemetery, Cheesman Park is believed to be haunted. In the late 1800s, the
                city hired undertaker E.P. McGovern to exhume and relocate the graves. McGovern was paid per coffin, so
                to increase profits, he often chopped up bodies and placed them in smaller caskets, sometimes cramming
                multiple remains into a single box. His careless methods left bodies improperly removed and ‘disturbed
                the dead’. Some bodies were never moved and still lie beneath the park today. Visitors report ghostly
                figures, eerie sounds, and feelings of unease, whilst the spirits are thought to be those whose graves
                were desecrated or forgotten. Join the Rocky Mountain Paranormal Research Society for haunted tours.

            <h3> Get Spooked at Ashcroft Ghost Town, Aspen</h3>
            <p>
                Just 10 miles from Aspen lies Ashcroft, a once-thriving silver mining town that has since fallen into
                ruin, yet still holds onto its haunting past. Visitors can explore multiple well-preserved buildings
                that paint a vivid picture of the lives once lived here. Walking among the dilapidated structures, it’s
                easy to imagine the bustling town in its heyday, only to be abandoned as quickly as it rose. For those
                interested in Aspen’s darker history, the DarkSide Tour offers a spine-chilling glimpse into the haunted
                history, as locals believe the ghosts of former residents may remain.

            <h3>
                Be Unsettled by Black Monarch Hotel, Victor
            </h3>
            <p>
                With its gothic decor and unsettling atmosphere, The Black Monarch Hotel in Victor, offers more than
                just a place to rest—it’s a chance to stay in a renovated boutique hotel with a notorious reputation for
                paranormal activity. With strange occurrences being reported for years, this eerie accommodation
                draws-in ghost hunters and thrill-seekers alike. Often dubbed one of the most haunted cities in
                Colorado, Victor itself is steeped in haunted history, as it was once a booming Gold Rush town that
                witnessed violent murders, untimely deaths, and horrific industrial accidents.

            <h3>
                Experience the Haunted History of Hotel Colorado, Glenwood Springs
            </h3>
            <p>
                Built in 1893, the historic Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs is famous not only for its grand
                architecture and storied past, but also for its paranormal activity. Guests and staff alike have
                encountered the ghost of a woman wailing in the night, flickering lights, and unexplained cold spots
                throughout the building. The basement, which was once used as a makeshift crematorium for World War II
                military personnel, adds another layer of spookiness to the hotel’s already haunted reputation.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Local Legends and Long Winding Roads, Phantom Canyon Road, Cripple Creek
            </h3>
            <p>
                Phantom Canyon Road is an old, narrow, unpaved route that winds its way through Colorado’s rugged
                mountains, elevating at 4,000 feet. The road passes through several dark, creepy tunnels and the ruins
                of ghost towns long abandoned after the Gold Rush. Many travellers who dare to drive this remote road
                report feeling an overwhelming sense of unease, especially as they approach the tunnels. Local legend
                tells of a ghost prisoner from the 1890s who was hanged near the canyon and is said to haunt the area.
                Those who have encountered him say his restless spirit still roams the road.
